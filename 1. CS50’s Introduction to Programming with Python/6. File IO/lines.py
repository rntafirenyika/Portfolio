Expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines.
If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program exits via sys.exit.
Assumes that any line that starts with # is a comment. (A docstring is not considered a comment.)
Assumes that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
