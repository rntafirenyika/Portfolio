        <h3>Products from Beekeeping</h3>

        <div class="paragraph">

             packaged bees, and beekeeping equipment. Some beekeepers may also offer honeycomb, propolis, and royal jelly.
              Some beekeepers also use bees for pollination services for crops like almond and blueberries.</p>
